    texts.format_text("""<li><strong>Impact of Plot Structures on Box Office Revenue</strong> Our regression analysis revealed that plot structures were relatively insignificant as a factor contributing to financial success. While certain plot clusters and genres showed some level of significance, this suggests that with higher-quality and more precise plot structure classifications, their contribution to financial success might become more evident. The current application of LLM models for classifying plot structures resulted in highly skewed classifications, indicating room for improvement in both methodology and model accuracy. Enhanced classification techniques could potentially uncover deeper insights into the role of plot structures in determining profitability. </li>
            <li><strong>Genre and Plot Structure Correlation</strong>: We found that specific genres are more likely to feature certain plot structures. For example, drama movies often follow hero's journey.</li>
            <li><strong>Temporal Trends in Plot Structures</strong>: The popularity of different plot structures has evolved over time. While classic structures like the hero's journey remain popular, newer structures are emerging and gaining traction in recent years.</li>
            <li><strong>Inflation Adjustment</strong>: Adjusting revenue and budget data for inflation provided a more accurate comparison across different time periods, allowing for consistent comparisons between budgets, revenues and profits. This adjustment was crucial for understanding the true financial success of movies from different eras. </li>
<li><strong>Key Factors Contributing to Commercial Success</strong>: Budget and rating score emerged as the most significant factors influencing commercial success. Budget, in particular, demonstrated a clear relationship with profit, showing a consistent reduction in risk on average as budget increases. However, lower-budget films exhibited significantly higher variability, underscoring the heightened financial risk and potential reward associated with smaller investments. </li>

While this skew still captures their variance and risk, it potentially does not accurately reflect the average performance of all low-budget films. </li>
<li><strong>Skewed Classification in LLM Application</strong>: The classification of plot structures using the current LLM model is highly skewed, which could contribute to the lack of significance observed in the relationship between plot structures and financial success.</li>
<li><strong>Simplistic Linear Regression Model</strong>: The use of a simple linear regression model may fail to capture the nuanced and complex relationships within the data, particularly those linked to plot structures and their potential impact on profitability. More advanced modeling techniques could provide deeper insights.</li>

    <span class="viridis-light">Our findings highlight the importance of storytelling and plot structures 
    in the film industry. While various factors contribute to a movie's success, 
    the plot structure remains a very important element that can significantly influence audience
    engagement and box office performance. This project showed that even by leveraging natural 
    language processing and machine learning techniques, it is difficult to quantify 
    and analyze the impact of plot structures on commercial success. It gives an overview of which 
    genres and plot structure are generally the most profitable ones, but no "secrete recipe" was found to make a movie profitable.</span>

    <span class="viridis-light">This project provides valuable insights for filmmakers, producers, and marketers, helping them make informed decisions about the types of stories that are likely to resonate with audiences and achieve financial success. Future research could further explore the role of other narrative elements, such as character development and dialogue, actors, directors, historical events influence etc.</span>
    <span class="viridis-light">Overall, the project underscores the timeless appeal of well-crafted stories and plot structure and their enduring power to captivate audiences and drive box office revenues (and profits).</span>
