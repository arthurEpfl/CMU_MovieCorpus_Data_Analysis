# # Introduction: Plot Structure Analysis for Movie Summaries
# 
# The goal of this notebook is to **process movie plot summaries to identify their underlying plot structures**. By categorizing each summary according to distinct narrative patterns, we aim to gain insights into common plot structures and explore potential correlations with financial success.
# 
# To achieve this, we experimented with **two different approaches**:
# 
# 1. **Clustering**: We used unsupervised clustering (KMeans) on plot summaries to explore any emergent plot structure patterns.
# 
# 2. **Large Language Model (LLM) Classification**: Using a predefined set of 15 plot structure categories, we use a LLM to classify each summary. This classification approach uses zero-shot prompting to assign each summary to a category.

def summarize_text(text):
    """
    Summarizes a plot summary if it exceeds a specified word count limit.

    This function leverages `facebook/bart-large-cnn` for summarization, handling lengthy plot summaries by dividing
    them into chunks when they exceed a set word count threshold. Each chunk is summarized separately, and the resulting
    summaries are concatenated to create a final, shorter version of the plot summary.

    Args:
        text (str): The input plot summary text to be summarized.

    Returns:
        str: The summarized text if the original text length exceeds the limit; otherwise, returns the original text.

    Logic:
        1. **Limit Check**: If the text's word count is below `limit` (600 words), the function returns the original text.
        2. **Chunking and Summarization**:
            - If the text exceeds `chunk_size` (700 words), it is divided into chunks of `chunk_size` words.
            - A 20-word overlap is added to the start of each subsequent chunk (except the first) to preserve context.
            - Each chunk is summarized individually.
            - The summaries of all chunks are concatenated to produce the final summary.
        3. **Single-Summary for Moderate-Length Texts**: If the text is above `limit` but under `chunk_size`, it is summarized
           directly without chunking.
