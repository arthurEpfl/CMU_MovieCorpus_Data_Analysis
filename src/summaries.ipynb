The second resident that the documentary focuses on is Tamara Allwood, who was at one point close to death from overeating but by the time of filming has gained enough autonomy to gain the rights to visit her mother in London. 35-year-old Tamara has become estranged from her mother, who has never properly understood Tamara's illness, which was diagnosed relatively late in her life. The meeting is unsuccessful. However, Tamara is hopeful by the end of the documentary, as she gets back together with an old boyfriend, who vows to protect her from her desire to eat. They get engaged and she has high hopes for the future.\",\n          \"The film is prefaced with a quotation from the poem \\\"The Young British Soldier\\\" by Rudyard Kipling:  When you're wounded an' left on Afghanistan's plains An' the women come out to cut up your remains Jus' roll to your rifle an' blow out your brains An' go to your Gawd like a soldier.  In 1981 Afghanistan, a Soviet tank unit viciously attacks a Pashtun village harboring a group of mujahideen fighters. Following the assault, one of the tanks, commanded by the ruthless Commander Daskal , gets separated from the unit and enters a blind valley. Taj  returns to discover the village destroyed, his father killed and his brother martyred by being crushed under the tank of the retreating Soviet forces. As the new khan, following his brother&#39;s death, Taj is spurred to seek revenge by his cousin, the scavenger Mustafa - and together they lead a band of mujahideen fighters into the valley to pursue the separated tank, counting on their RPG-7 anti-tank weapon to destroy it. The tank&#39;s crew is made up of four Soviets and an Afghan communist soldier. As night falls and the crew sets up camp, the Afghan tank crewman Samad  educates the tank driver, Konstantin Koverchenko , about the fundamental principles of Pashtunwali, the Pashtun people&#39;s code of honour: milmastia , badal , and nanawatai, which requires even an enemy to be given sanctuary if he asks. As the plot progresses, Commander Daskal  demonstrates his ruthlessness not only to the enemy, but also to his own men. He despises Samad for his ethnic association to the enemy and, after a couple attempts to kill him, finally gets his wish on the pretext of suspecting Samad of collaborating with the mujahadeen. After Koverchenko threatens to report Daskal for the killing, Daskal entraps him and orders Kaminski  and Golikov  to tie him to a rock, with a grenade behind his head to serve as booby-trap for the mujahideen. Some wild dogs come upon him and as Koverchenko tries to kick at them, the grenade rolls down the rock and explodes, killing several dogs but leaving Konstantin unhurt. A group of women from the village, who had been trailing the mujahideen to offer their support, come across Koverchenko and begin to stone him, calling for his blood as revenge . As the mujahideen approach, Koverchenko recalls the term nanawatai  and repeats it until Taj cuts him free, and allows him to follow their procession. That night, hidden in a cave, the fighters eat - and Taj asks Koverchenko in broken language if he will fix their broken RPG-7, and help them destroy the tank. As the remaining three members of the tank crew begin to realize they are trapped in the valley, a Soviet helicopter appears and offers to rescue them. Daskal, caring more for his tank than his men, refuses the offer and simply refills the vehicle&#39;s oil and gasoline. They get their bearings from the helicopter pilot and head back into the narrow mountain pass from which they came, looking for the way out of the valley. Ironically, they later return to a water hole  to cool the engines, and find the helicopter crew dead, having drunk from the small pool. The mujahideen and Koverchenko catch up with the tank crew there, and a cat-and-mouse chase begins near the mountain pass, culminating in an opportunity for Koverchenko to disable the tank with the RPG. Konstantin fires as the tank is going out of range, but hits only the main gun. Just as it seems the tank will escape, an explosion set off by the village women in the cliffs above the tank sets boulders rolling onto it, disabling it at last. The tank crew is forced out and Koverchenko pleads nanawatai on their behalf. Taj reluctantly agrees. Konstantin tells Daskal that he wants him to live to see the Soviets lose the war, which is &#34;no Stalingrad&#34;, and states that &#34;It's hard to be a good soldier in a rotten war...how is it that we're the Nazis this time?\\\" Kaminski and Golikov flee on foot, but Daskal is overrun by the women, who carry out their revenge by stoning him before taking his bloodied uniform and boots as trophies and being reprimanded by Taj for their barbaric and merciless act. A Soviet search-and-rescue helicopter appears, and despite the camaraderie that has developed between him and Taj, Konstantin goes with the helicopter. Taj orders his men not to fire on him as he is being hoisted up into the helicopter. Before being hoisted up, Koverchenko salutes Taj by holding an Afghan jezail musket, which Taj gave to him earlier, above his head. The film ends with Koverchenko being hoisted up to the flying helicopter, flying away, the jezail still clenched in his hand.\",\n          \"Motorist Jane Lindstrom has a blowout and seeks assistance at an estate owned by Caligari, a very polite man with a German accent. After spending the night she finds that Caligari will not let her leave; he proceeds to ask some personal questions and shows her disgusting pictures. Prevented by guards from leaving, and unable to telephone, Jane seeks allies among the other guests but finds only three possible candidates: the older Paul, the younger Mark , and a lively elderly woman named Ruth. After seeing Ruth tortured, Jane goes to Paul who convinces her to confront Caligari. Jane does so and tries to seduce him, as she suspects he has been spying on her in the bath. After that fails, Caligari reveals that he and Paul and are one and the same person and Jane runs down a corridor of wildly shifting imagery that acts as a transition. Finally it is revealed that Jane is a mental patient and everything the audience has seen up to this point has been her distortion of the institute she was in: the personal questions were psychoanalysis, the disgusting pictures were Rorschach cards, Ruth's torture was shock treatment, and even Caligari's coat of arms was a distorted version of the medical caduceus symbol. Cured, Jane is taken from the asylum by Mark, now revealed to be her son; and then we see Jane's face. She now has many wrinkles implying that she is far older than the smooth-skinned woman we have seen through most of the film.

She enjoys a healthy relationship with her family. On her birthday, her parents give her a laptop. She is rather naive in respect of some of the ways in which the Internet can be harmful. When she meets Charlie in an online chat room, she establishes an instant connection with him. At first, Charlie states that he is sixteen years old. Over time, as the two bond by sending phone text messages and through instant messaging, he bumps his age up to 20, then 25. Annie is taken aback at first. She then dismisses these concerns. She continues the on-line relationship, not wanting to end things with him because she is flattered by the attention. After three months of communicating electronically, Charlie invites Annie to meet him at the mall. When they first come into contact, Annie discovers that Charlie is significantly older than he presented himself to be. He appears to be in has late thirties or early forties. Annie is upset about him having lied about his age, but still spends time with him after he coaxes her to ignore the age difference, even to the point of driving to a motel with him. Despite the fact that Annie is a minor, Charlie proceeds to inappropriately touch her and makes her model lingerie. He then coaxes her onto the bed and then rapes her. He secretly films what he does to Annie. Annie tells her best friend, Brittany, about her sexual encounter with Charlie. Brittany is concerned about this and tells the school counselor, who then calls the police, drawing unwanted attention from fellow students at her high school. These actions initiate an FBI investigation. Annie is used to help trap Charlie using online communication, but he soon figures out the ruse and breaks off contact with her before the police can track his location. Annie's father, Will, starts his own obsessive investigation, taking up the services of a private investigation firm in New Jersey. He even steals a collection of his daughter's chat conversations with Charlie from the FBI. His relationship with his wife Lynn begins to deteriorate and he questions his work at an advertising firm, which uses provocative advertisements involving teenagers. When Will tells his boss that his daughter was sexually assaulted, his boss is shocked but becomes dismissive when told that Annie knew the man and went willingly to the hotel, saying \"it could have been a lot worse.\" Annie is angry at Brittany for not keeping her relationship with Charlie secret. She still believes that Charlie loves her and she is livid at her parents for making her betray him and for forbidding her to contact him anymore. Although Charlie has not been identified, DNA evidence provides a high degree of proof that he has behaved in the same manner with other young girls who reported it to the police. This causes Annie to be devastated because she thought she was the only girl in his life. After seeing pictures of the other girls, she feels betrayed. She finally admits to herself, and to a hospital counselor, that she was raped. The next day, Annie tries to move on with her life by participating in her school's volleyball game. There, Will sees a man in the crowd. Not only is he taking pictures of the girls in the game, but he also looks surprisingly similar to one of the registered sex offenders a private New Jersey investigation firm provided him pictures with. An irate Will interrupts the game in order to confront the man. He\n","14-year-old Annie Cameron meets Charlie in an online chat room.

An irate Will interrupts the game in order to confront the man. He beats him to the floor, causing a scene. A girl in the game reveals the man to be her father. The assaulted man chooses not to press charges for fear that he will be outed to his family. Will apologizes to the man but Annie feels humiliated. At home, Annie confronts her father. Annie insists that she wants to move on with her life. She believes that Will does not fully appreciate her position as the victim. Annie hears from Brittany about a website in which people are belittling the fact that she was raped. This pushes her over the edge. At home, she locks herself in the bathroom and attempts suicide by overdosing with pills, but is saved by her father. Brittany spends the night to keep her company mending their broken friendship. Annie wakes up early the next day, and discovers her father sitting outside in the freezing cold weather. She approaches him, asking if he is all right. Will begins talking to her, reminiscing about the first time she ever got in the family pool, and how brave she was to do it. He tells her that she used to be confident, and nothing frightened her. He admired the way she loved the world and trusted the people in it and how now all that has changed. He weeps and pleads for forgiveness even though he believes he does not deserve it.

Annie is used to help trap Charlie using online communication, but he soon figures out the ruse and breaks off contact with her before the police can track his location. Although Charlie has not been identified, DNA evidence provides a high degree of proof that he has behaved in the same manner with other young girls who reported it to police.Annie hears from Brittany about a website in which people are belittling the fact that she was raped. She locks herself in the bathroom and attempts suicide by overdosing with pills, but is saved by her father. Annie wakes up early the next day, and discovers her father sitting outside in the freezing cold weather. She approaches him, asking if he is all right. He tells her that she used to be confident, and nothing frightened her. He weeps and pleads for forgiveness even though he believes he does not deserve it. As the credits roll, a home video reveals Charlie to be a high school physics teacher named Graham Weston, a married father with a young son. Annie starts to cry and then embraces him. Annie insists that she wants to move on with her life.\n","len text 1976\n","word_count  347\n","len text 3925\n","word_count  641\n","0 0 600\n","chunk : In mid-April 1941, during World War II, German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel and his Afrika Korps have driven the British Army into headlong retreat across North Africa toward Egypt and the vital Suez Canal. Standing in Rommel's way is Tobruk, a constant threat to his supply lines. The 9th Australian Division are asked to hold the port for two months, at which time they are to be relieved. The defending Allied general ([[Robert Douglas chooses English Captain \"Tammy\" MacRoberts , an experienced field officer, to take command of a company of newly-arrived, green Australian troops. The no-nonsense MacRoberts is disliked by the undisciplined Australians. He is surprised to see in their ranks his former schoolmaster, Tom Bartlett . Barlett, an alcoholic, later explains that after being dismissed from his job in England due to his drinking, he went to Australia and joined the army while intoxicated. MacRoberts offers to transfer him to a safer billet, but Bartlett turns him down. Because of the desperate situation, the inexperienced troops are sent directly into the front line. The men dig foxholes and prepare for Rommel's certain attack. The Allied general masses his artillery where he guesses the Germans will strike. His gamble pays off. Under cover of a sandstorm, they attack exactly where the general predicted and head directly at MacRoberts' men. In the fierce battle, Captain Currie is wounded. Lieutenant Harry Carstairs abandons his vital post to go to his aid, in vain. After the Germans are beaten back, an infuriated MacRoberts vows to have Carstairs court-martialed for disobeying orders and leaving a dangerous hole in the line, but Bartlett persuades MacRoberts to retract his request. MacRoberts receives a field promotion to major, then a temporary one to lieutenant colonel after the general elevates him to command of his battalion of Australians. The general then decides to erode the besiegers' confidence by sending out small commando raids every night. MacRoberts' patrols do their part in exacting a toll on the enemy. One day, the general worries about reports of German heavy artillery being moved up, indicating an attack is imminent. The suspected location of the artillery's ammunition dump is too far away to be attacked by the usual nighttime raid, so MacRoberts proposes using trucks abandoned by the Italians to drive there in disguise and blow it up. MacRoberts leads 54 picked men in three trucks. The attack is a success, but Carstairs is killed and MacRoberts is wounded and captured. While he is being attended to, he meets Rommel, who has been shot by a strafing Spitfire. Although he is respectful to the field marshal, MacRoberts defiantly points out that Tobruk is a thorn in his side. Rommel is bemused by his brashness and orders that he be treated well. Later, as the prisoners are being transported, their trucks are attacked by British fighter aircraft. In the confusion, MacRoberts and Sergeant \"Blue\" Smith get away. After an exhausting walk through the desert, they reach friendly lines. The Australians have now held on for eight months. In November, the general tells his officers that a relief column led by General Claude Auchinleck is headed for Tobruk. However, they need to take control of a key hill that overlooks the road that Auchinleck must use. The general asks MacRoberts to take his best company and hold the position for three days. On the morning of the ninth day, fearing that the men can take no more, MacRoberts orders a retreat, though Bartlett begs him to ask the men to hang on.

Long ago, his master was murdered by Jade Fox , a woman who sought to learn Wudang skills. Mu Bai is also a good friend of Yu Shu Lien , a female warrior. Mu Bai and Shu Lien have developed feelings for each other, but they have never acknowledged or acted on them. Mu Bai, intending to give up his warrior life, asks Shu Lien to transport his sword, also referred to as the Green Destiny, to the city of Peking, as a gift for their friend Sir Te . At Sir Te's estate, Shu Lien meets Jen , the daughter of Governor Yu , a visiting Manchu aristocrat. Jen, destined for an arranged marriage and yearning for adventure, seems envious of Shu Lien's warrior lifestyle. One evening, a masked thief sneaks into Sir Te's estate and steals the sword. Mu Bai and Shu Lien trace the theft to Governor Yu's compound and learn that Jade Fox has been posing as Jen's governess for many years. Mu Bai makes the acquaintance of Inspector Tsai , a police investigator from the provinces, and his daughter May ([[Li Li , who have come to Peking in pursuit of Fox. Fox challenges the pair and Sir Te's servant Master Bo to a showdown that night. Following a protracted battle, the group is on the verge of defeat when Mu Bai arrives and outmaneuvers Fox. Before Mu Bai can kill Fox, the masked thief reappears and partners with Fox to fight. Fox resumes the fight and kills Tsai before fleeing with the thief . After seeing Jen fight Mu Bai, Fox realizes Jen had been secretly studying the Wudang manual and has surpassed her in skill. At night, a desert bandit named Lo breaks into Jen's bedroom and asks her to leave with him. A flashback reveals that in the past, when Governor Yu and his family were traveling in the western deserts, Lo and his bandits had raided Jen's caravan and kidnapped her. However, Lo and Jen soon fell passionately in love. Lo eventually convinced Jen to return to her family, though not before telling her a legend of a man who jumped off a cliff to make his wishes come true. Because the man's heart was pure, he did not die. Lo came to Peking to persuade Jen not to go through with her arranged marriage. However, Jen refuses to leave with him. Later, Lo interrupts Jen's wedding procession, begging her to come away with him. Nearby, Shu Lien and Mu Bai convince Lo to wait for Jen at Wudan Mountain, where he will be safe from Jen's family, who are furious with him. Jen visits Shu Lien, who tells her that Lo is waiting for her at Wudang Mountain. After an angry dispute, the two women engage in a duel. Wielding the Green Destiny, Jen destroys each weapon that Shu Lien wields until losing to a broken sword held at her neck. When Shu Lien shows mercy and lowers the sword, Jen injures Shu Lien's arm. Mu Bai arrives and pursues Jen into a bamboo forest. Following a duel where Mu Bai regains possession of the Green Destiny, he decides to throw the sword over a waterfall.

Vicky later accuses Kevin of being with her only for sex, and he must try and repair his relationship with her before the upcoming prom night, when the four plan to lose their virginity. He eventually succeeds. Oz, meanwhile, joins the jazz choir in an effort to lose his reputation as an insensitive jock and finds a girlfriend there. He soon wins the attention of Heather , a girl in the choir. However, he runs into problems when Heather comes to learn about Oz's reputation and subsequently breaks up with him, although he later manages to regain some of her trust, and later most of it when he leaves the lacrosse championship to perform a duet with her in a choir competition. Jim, meanwhile, attempts to pursue Nadia , an exchange student from Czechoslovakia who asks Jim for help to study for an upcoming test. Stifler persuades him to set up a webcam in his room so that they can all watch it together. The plan suffers a hiccup, though, when Nadia discovers Jim's pornography collection and sits half-naked on his bed to read and masturbate to it. Jim is persuaded to return to his room, where he joins Nadia, unaware that he accidentally sent the weblink to the entire school directory and the members of the pop-punk band Blink-182. As Nadia is preparing to have sex with him, he prematurely ejaculates twice, humiliating himself live in front of the entire school. Shortly afterwards Nadia leaves school and goes back home, now leaving Jim completely dateless for prom, and his likeliness of losing his virginity before high school is over. In sheer desperation, Jim asks band camp geek Michelle Flaherty to the senior prom as she is apparently the only girl at his school who did not see what happened. Finch, meanwhile, pays Vicky's friend, Jessica , $200 to spread rumors around the school of his sexual prowess, hoping that it will increase his chances of success. Unfortunately, he runs into trouble when Stifler, angry that a girl turned him down for the prom because she was waiting for Finch to ask her, puts a laxative into Finch's cappuccino. Finch, being paranoid about the lack of cleanliness in the school restrooms, and unable to go home to use the toilet as he usually does, is tricked by Stifler into using the girls' restroom. Afterward, he emerges before many other fellow students, humiliated and is left dateless.

Vicky later accuses Kevin of being with her only for sex, and he must try and repair his relationship with her before the upcoming prom night, when the four plan to lose their virginity. He eventually succeeds. Oz, meanwhile, joins the jazz choir in an effort to lose his reputation as an insensitive jock and finds a girlfriend there. He soon wins the attention of Heather , a girl in the choir. However, he runs into problems when Heather comes to learn about Oz's reputation and subsequently breaks up with him, although he later manages to regain some of her trust, and later most of it when he leaves the lacrosse championship to perform a duet with her in a choir competition. Jim, meanwhile, attempts to pursue Nadia , an exchange student from Czechoslovakia who asks Jim for help to study for an upcoming test. Stifler persuades him to set up a webcam in his room so that they can all watch it together. The plan suffers a hiccup, though, when Nadia discovers Jim's pornography collection and sits half-naked on his bed to read and masturbate to it. Jim is persuaded to return to his room, where he joins Nadia, unaware that he accidentally sent the weblink to the entire school directory and the members of the pop-punk band Blink-182. As Nadia is preparing to have sex with him, he prematurely ejaculates twice, humiliating himself live in front of the entire school. Shortly afterwards Nadia leaves school and goes back home, now leaving Jim completely dateless for prom, and his likeliness of losing his virginity before high school is over. In sheer desperation, Jim asks band camp geek Michelle Flaherty  to the senior prom as she is apparently the only girl at his school who did not see what happened. Finch, meanwhile, pays Vicky's friend, Jessica , $200 to spread rumors around the school of his sexual prowess, hoping that it will increase his chances of success. Unfortunately, he runs into trouble when Stifler, angry that a girl turned him down for the prom because she was waiting for Finch to ask her, puts a laxative into Finch's cappuccino. Finch, being paranoid about the lack of cleanliness in the school restrooms, and unable to go home to use the toilet as he usually does, is tricked by Stifler into using the girls' restroom. Afterward, he emerges before many other fellow students, humiliated and is left dateless. At the prom, everything seems hopeless for the four boys until Vicky asks the girl that Chuck Sherman claimed to have bedded about her \\\"first time.\\\" She proclaims to everyone at the prom that she and Sherman did not have sex at Stifler's party, leaving Sherman embarrassed and making him wet himself. The revelation takes the pressure off of Jim, Kevin, Oz and Finch, and they head to the post-prom party with new hope. At the after-party at Stifler's house, all four boys fulfill their pledge. Kevin and Vicky have sex in an upstairs bedroom. Vicky breaks up with Kevin afterwards on the grounds that they will drift apart when they go to college, with him attending the University of Michigan and her at Cornell University; he tries to persuade her otherwise but quickly realizes that the distance between the two schools will be too much of a burden. Oz confesses the pact to Heather, and renounces it, saying that just by them being together makes him a winner. They reconcile and wind up making love together on the dock. Oz, honoring his newfound sensitivity, never confesses to what they did. Jim and Michelle have sex after he finds out that she is actually not as na\\u00efve as she let on and that she saw the \\\"Nadia Incident\\\" after all. She accepted his offer to be his date because of it, knowing he was a \\\"sure thing,\\\" but she makes him wear two condoms to combat his earlier \\\"problem\\\" with Nadia. Jim is surprised to discover that Michelle behaves unexpectedly aggressively in bed. In the morning he wakes up to find her gone and realizes that she had used him for a one-night stand, which Jim thinks is \\\"cool.\\\" Dateless, Finch strays downstairs to the basement recreation room where he meets Stifler's Mom . She is aroused by his precociousness, and they have sex on the pool table. In the morning, Stifler enters the room, realizes that his mom has had sex with Finch and faints, unable to believe that his mom and \\\"Shit-break\\\" are together. The morning after the prom Jim, Kevin, Oz, and Finch eat breakfast at their favorite restaurant - with the fitting nostalgic name, \\\"Dog Years\\\" - where they toast to \\\"the next step.\\\" The film ends with Nadia watching Jim stripping on his webcam.

She storms upstairs to complain, whereupon Jerry falls hopelessly in love with her and proceeds to pursue her all over London. Dale mistakes Jerry for Horace, who is married to her friend Madge . Following the success of Jerry\\'s opening night in London, Jerry follows Dale to Venice, where she is visiting Madge and modelling/promoting the gowns created by Alberto Beddini ([[Erik Rhodes , a dandified Italian fashion designer with a penchant for malapropisms. Jerry proposes to Dale, who, while still believing that Jerry is Horace, is disgusted that her friend\\'s husband could behave in such a manner and agrees instead to marry Alberto. Fortunately, Bates , Horace\\'s meddling English valet, disguises himself as a priest and conducts the ceremony; apparently, Horace had sent Bates to keep tabs on Dale. On a trip in a gondola, Jerry manages to convince Dale and they return to the hotel where the previous confusion is rapidly cleared up. The reconciled couple dance off into the Venetian sunset, to the tune of \"The Piccolino\".Adapted from Billman\"\\nClassification (choose one):\\n', 'labels': ['Quest for Vengeance or Justice', 'Conflict with Supernatural or Unknown Forces', 'Hero’s Journey and Transformation', 'Comedy of Errors or Misadventure', 'Rise and Fall of a Protagonist', 'Coming of Age and Self-Discovery', 'Tragedy and Inevitability', 'Power Struggle and Betrayal', 'Survival or Escape', 'Crime and Underworld Exploration', 'Love and Relationship Dynamics', 'Comedy in Domestic Life', 'Mystery and Conspiracy Unveiling', 'Social Rebellion or Fight Against Oppression', 'Fantasy or Science Fiction Quest'], 'scores': [0.1297655701637268, 0.10755410045385361, 0.10319439321756363, 0.09803496301174164, 0.08521895855665207, 0.07389846444129944, 0.07066953182220459, 0.060115426778793335, 0.056698866188526154, 0.05588943511247635, 0.042832329869270325, 0.041082073003053665, 0.03118833340704441, 0.025588305667042732, 0.018269173800945282]}\n","classification :  Quest for Vengeance or Justice\n","response :  {'sequence': '\\nClassify the following plot summary into one of these categories.

Shaken, Mike decides to concentrate on law school, while promising his girlfriend and fellow law student Jo  to not play the game anymore. Mentor and fellow rounder Knish  offers him a part-time job driving a delivery truck to make ends meet. Time passes, and Mike is true to his promise. He does not play cards, and focuses on school and work until his childhood friend Lester \\'Worm\\' Murphy  is released from prison. Worm is also a card player, who owes an outstanding debt accumulated before his incarceration. At Worm\\'s influence, Mike is soon rounding again, which interferes with his studies and hurts his relationship with Jo, who eventually leaves him. When Worm is given a five day deadline to pay off his debt, Mike joins him in a furious race to earn the money by playing in several card games in and around New York City. The two come close to making the $15,000 needed, yet end up losing their entire bankroll when they are caught cheating at a poker game, despite Mike\\'s insistence on playing the game straight. After this incident, Worm decides to leave the city, and advises Mike to do the same. This is when he reveals to Mike that his debt is due to KGB, the very same Russian mobster who had cleaned Mike out of his $30,000 bankroll months before. Infuriated, Mike cuts ties with Worm once and for all. Mike refuses to flee, and instead, with the help of a loan from his law school professor Petrovsky , sits down to play KGB heads-up in a No-Limit Texas Hold\\'em game. In a race against time to pay off Worm\\'s debt, Mike gets his shot at redemption as he puts his life on the line against the man who had forced him out of the game. Mike eventually beats KGB in two heated heads-up matches in which he ultimately wins enough to pay off Worm\\'s debt, repay his loan to the professor, and regain his original bankroll of about $30,000. The movie ends with Mike officially dropping out of law school, saying goodbye to Jo and going to Las Vegas to play in the World Series of Poker Main Event.\"\\nClassification (choose one):\\n', 'labels': ['Hero’s Journey and Transformation', 'Quest for Vengeance or Justice', 'Tragedy and Inevitability', 'Conflict with Supernatural or Unknown Forces', 'Survival or Escape', 'Social Rebellion or Fight Against Oppression', 'Coming of Age and Self-Discovery', 'Rise and Fall of a Protagonist', 'Comedy of Errors or Misadventure', 'Love and Relationship Dynamics', 'Power Struggle and Betrayal', 'Mystery and Conspiracy Unveiling', 'Crime and Underworld Exploration', 'Comedy in Domestic Life', 'Fantasy or Science Fiction Quest'], 'scores': [0.19693319499492645, 0.11335496604442596, 0.08404439687728882, 0.07751874625682831, 0.07252727448940277, 0.06692773848772049, 0.06627456843852997, 0.049601346254348755, 0.04628892242908478, 0.04344702139496803, 0.04294459894299507, 0.03953153267502785, 0.03800773620605469, 0.03480018302798271, 0.027797697111964226]}\n","classification :  Hero’s Journey and Transformation\n","response :  {'sequence': '\\nClassify the following plot summary into one of these categories.

Both Jeffrey and Elaine find themselves attracted to Robert, who becomes a frequent guest in their Malibu home and soon drifts into a sexual relationship with the manipulative producer.

Vicky later accuses Kevin of being with her only for sex, and he must try and repair his relationship with her before the upcoming prom night, when the four plan to lose their virginity. He eventually succeeds. Oz, meanwhile, joins the jazz choir in an effort to lose his reputation as an insensitive jock and finds a girlfriend there. He soon wins the attention of Heather , a girl in the choir. However, he runs into problems when Heather comes to learn about Oz's reputation and subsequently breaks up with him, although he later manages to regain some of her trust, and later most of it when he leaves the lacrosse championship to perform a duet with her in a choir competition. Jim, meanwhile, attempts to pursue Nadia , an exchange student from Czechoslovakia who asks Jim for help to study for an upcoming test. Stifler persuades him to set up a webcam in his room so that they can all watch it together. The plan suffers a hiccup, though, when Nadia discovers Jim's pornography collection and sits half-naked on his bed to read and masturbate to it. Jim is persuaded to return to his room, where he joins Nadia, unaware that he accidentally sent the weblink to the entire school directory and the members of the pop-punk band Blink-182. As Nadia is preparing to have sex with him, he prematurely ejaculates twice, humiliating himself live in front of the entire school. Shortly afterwards Nadia leaves school and goes back home, now leaving Jim completely dateless for prom, and his likeliness of losing his virginity before high school is over. In sheer desperation, Jim asks band camp geek Michelle Flaherty  to the senior prom as she is apparently the only girl at his school who did not see what happened. Finch, meanwhile, pays Vicky's friend, Jessica , $200 to spread rumors around the school of his sexual prowess, hoping that it will increase his chances of success. Unfortunately, he runs into trouble when Stifler, angry that a girl turned him down for the prom because she was waiting for Finch to ask her, puts a laxative into Finch's cappuccino. Finch, being paranoid about the lack of cleanliness in the school restrooms, and unable to go home to use the toilet as he usually does, is tricked by Stifler into using the girls' restroom. Afterward, he emerges before many other fellow students, humiliated and is left dateless. At the prom, everything seems hopeless for the four boys until Vicky asks the girl that Chuck Sherman claimed to have bedded about her \\\"first time.\\\" She proclaims to everyone at the prom that she and Sherman did not have sex at Stifler's party, leaving Sherman embarrassed and making him wet himself. The revelation takes the pressure off of Jim, Kevin, Oz and Finch, and they head to the post-prom party with new hope. At the after-party at Stifler's house, all four boys fulfill their pledge. Kevin and Vicky have sex in an upstairs bedroom. Vicky breaks up with Kevin afterwards on the grounds that they will drift apart when they go to college, with him attending the University of Michigan and her at Cornell University; he tries to persuade her otherwise but quickly realizes that the distance between the two schools will be too much of a burden. Oz confesses the pact to Heather, and renounces it, saying that just by them being together makes him a winner. They reconcile and wind up making love together on the dock. Oz, honoring his newfound sensitivity, never confesses to what they did. Jim and Michelle have sex after he finds out that she is actually not as na\\u00efve as she let on and that she saw the \\\"Nadia Incident\\\" after all. She accepted his offer to be his date because of it, knowing he was a \\\"sure thing,\\\" but she makes him wear two condoms to combat his earlier \\\"problem\\\" with Nadia. Jim is surprised to discover that Michelle behaves unexpectedly aggressively in bed. In the morning he wakes up to find her gone and realizes that she had used him for a one-night stand, which Jim thinks is \\\"cool.\\\" Dateless, Finch strays downstairs to the basement recreation room where he meets Stifler's Mom . She is aroused by his precociousness, and they have sex on the pool table. In the morning, Stifler enters the room, realizes that his mom has had sex with Finch and faints, unable to believe that his mom and \\\"Shit-break\\\" are together. The morning after the prom Jim, Kevin, Oz, and Finch eat breakfast at their favorite restaurant - with the fitting nostalgic name, \\\"Dog Years\\\" - where they toast to \\\"the next step.\\\" The film ends with Nadia watching Jim stripping on his webcam. His dad walks in but walks out and starts dancing like Jim.\",\n          \"Bo Laramie  is a famous Hollywood actor dealing with the negative sides of high publicity. After his wife  and son  are badly injured in a car accident, he decides to take revenge by murdering three of the four paparazzi photographers who were responsible for the accident , then pinning the murders on the ringleader .\",\n          \"Millionaire hotel mogul Ray Hunter  flies to Rome to buy another property, the Regent. He is picked up at the airport by lovely Maria Martelli , who works for the hotel's owner, the Countess Alzani. Ray is reproached by the Countess for the impersonal way he buys up hotels this way, piling up \\\"ten thousand bedrooms\\\" and replacing employees without a second thought. He sincerely promises not to do so with the staff of the Regent. Maria is impressed and volunteers to be Ray's translator while in town. He meets the Martelli family, including Papa Vittorio  and his other daughters. Maria's youngest sister, 18-year-old Nina , takes an almost immediate liking to Ray. Maria's current romantic interest is Anton , a poor Polish count who fancies himself a sculptor. Nina, meanwhile, tries to catch Ray's eye, while his private pilot Mike  is trying to catch hers. Nina sees the sights with Ray and wants to marry him, so she asks her father for permission. Papa Martelli forbids it, saying in this family all of the eldest daughters must be married before the youngest can. Ray tries to speed up that process. He sends for two eligible bachelors from America on the pretense of business. They are quickly introduced to two other sisters of Maria and Nina. But when he makes the mistake of buying Anton's artwork in order to make the poor count feel worthy of proposing to Maria, it backfires. Maria is furious and Ray apologizes with a kiss. Suddenly realizing he is involved with the wrong sister, Ray is in a fix. At a party, Papa Martelli is rushed into saying Ray is engaged to daughter Nina, which upsets Mike so much that he decides to leave. Ray hurriedly urges Mike to stay and fight for the girl he loves. It takes some doing, but everything finally works out. Ray finds a job for Anton that involves him traveling to Bombay for a long period of time. Meanwhile, he persuades Maria that he's sincere, and next thing you know, Papa Martelli is planning four weddings.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"plot_structure\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Quest for Vengeance or Justice\",\n          \"Survival or Escape\",\n          \"Hero\\u2019s Journey and Transformation\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"movie_genres\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"{\\\"/m/06cvj\\\": \\\"Romantic comedy\\\", \\\"/m/0gsy3b\\\": \\\"Sex comedy\\\", \\\"/m/01j1n2\\\": \\\"Coming of age\\\", \\\"/m/01z4y\\\": \\\"Comedy\\\", \\\"/m/02l7c8\\\": \\\"Romance Film\\\", \\\"/m/02b5_l\\\": \\\"Teen\\\"}\",\n          \"{\\\"/m/01jfsb\\\": \\\"Thriller\\\", \\\"/m/02wtdps\\\": \\\"Crime Thriller\\\", \\\"/m/07s9rl0\\\": \\\"Drama\\\", \\\"/m/0219x_\\\": \\\"Indie\\\"}\",\n          \"{\\\"/m/06cvj\\\": \\\"Romantic comedy\\\", \\\"/m/04t36\\\": \\\"Musical\\\", \\\"/m/01z4y\\\": \\\"Comedy\\\", \\\"/m/0220p9g\\\": \\\"Musical comedy\\\"}\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":18}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# prompt: print only the columns plot_structure, clean_summary and movie_genre of merged_sample\n","\n","merged_sample[['plot_structure', 'clean_plot_summary', 'summarized_plot', 'movie_genres']]"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":3859},"id":"uXGravnocNNa","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1730912896902,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":271,"user":{"displayName":"Adam Ezzaim","userId":"14604190585490120229"}},"outputId":"b1a004ff-c640-4529-e312-2e7b2742fc90"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                     plot_structure  \\\n","0  Crime and Underworld Exploration   \n","1                            Comedy   \n","2    Love and Relationship Dynamics   \n","3  Crime and Underworld Exploration   \n","4  Crime and Underworld Exploration   \n","5                            Comedy   \n","6                             Drama   \n","7                             Drama   \n","8                            Comedy   \n","9    Love and Relationship Dynamics   \n","\n","                                  clean_plot_summary  \\\n","0  in brooklyn new york from november through ear...   \n","1  gavin grey is a s star athlete known by the mo...   \n","2  stone asks gannon to speak before a nightschoo...   \n","3  the film begins with the funeral of one of the...   \n","4  detective lucas mccarthy finally catches the s...   \n","5  it is february in the city of chicago two frie...   \n","6  the film is set amongst a group of gungnyeo or...   \n","7  waterland follows the story of a mentally angu...   \n","8  rudy robles is told by his mother to pick up h...   \n","9  wealthy american jervis pendleton iii has a ch...   \n","\n","                                     summarized_plot  \\\n","0   bobby green is manager of a successful el car...   \n","1   gavin grey is a star athlete known by the mon...   \n","2  stone asks gannon to speak before a nightschoo...   \n","3  the film begins with the funeral of one of the...   \n","4  detective lucas mccarthy finally catches the s...   \n","5   it is february in the city of chicago two fri...   \n","6   The film is set amongst a group of gungnyeo o...   \n","7  waterland follows the story of a mentally angu...   \n","8   rudy robles is told by his mother to pick up ...   \n","9  wealthy american jervis pendleton iii has a ch...   \n","\n","                                        movie_genres  \n","0  {\"/m/0lsxr\": \"Crime Fiction\", \"/m/01jfsb\": \"Th...  \n","1  {\"/m/01z02hx\": \"Sports\", \"/m/068d7h\": \"Romanti...  \n","2  {\"/m/06cvj\": \"Romantic comedy\", \"/m/02l7c8\": \"...  \n","3  {\"/m/0lsxr\": \"Crime Fiction\", \"/m/0gw5w78\": \"G...  \n","4     {\"/m/03npn\": \"Horror\", \"/m/01585b\": \"Slasher\"}  \n","5  {\"/m/06cvj\": \"Romantic comedy\", \"/m/0gsy3b\": \"...  \n","6  {\"/m/01jfsb\": \"Thriller\", \"/m/02n4kr\": \"Myster...  \n","7  {\"/m/07s9rl0\": \"Drama\", \"/m/0219x_\": \"Indie\", ...  \n","8  {\"/m/0gf28\": \"Parody\", \"/m/0hj3mz5\": \"Comedy o...  \n","9  {\"/m/02l7c8\": \"Romance Film\", \"/m/07s9rl0\": \"D...

The two get into an argument where Stephanie announces Paxton's paranoia as insufferable and exaggerated. She awakes the next morning to find her boyfriend decapitated. An unmarked box  is then delivered to Elite Hunting boss Sasha , as he relaxes at an outdoor cafe with his bloodhounds. In Italy, three art students, wealthy Beth , tough Whitney , and outcast Lorna  are convinced by Axelle , a nude model they are sketching to join her on a vacation to a luxurious spa. The four travel to a small Slovakian village and check into the local hostel, where the desk clerk uploads their passport photos to an auction website, and American businessman Todd  submits the winning bids on Whitney and Beth for himself and his passive best friend Stuart . Later that night, at the village's \\\"Harvest Festival\\\", Lorna discovers that Beth has inherited a vast fortune from her mother. Stuart approaches Beth and the two share a friendly, albeit awkward, conversation. An intoxicated Lorna is taken for a boat ride, resulting in her kidnapping. Beth and Whitney leave the party, while Axelle volunteers to stay behind and wait for Lorna. Whitney wants to sleep with local Miroslav  but Beth talks her into calling it a night. The next morning, the now naked and gagged Lorna is hung upside down with her ankles and wrists tightly shackled. A woman named Mrs. Bathory  enters the room, undresses, and lies beneath Lorna. She then uses a long scythe to repeatedly slash Lorna's back and torso, and revels in bathing in Lorna's blood, before fatally slashing her victim's throat. Beth, Whitney, Axelle and Miroslav go to the hot springs spa to relax, where Beth falls asleep. She then awakens to find herself alone and her belongings stolen. As she looks for her friends, she notices several men approaching and surrounding her. Fearing for her life, she flees, but is ambushed by a gang of violent street children. However, Axelle and Sasha appear and ward them away from her. Sasha then murders one of the children as punishment. At a factory, Whitney is strapped to a chair in one of the cells. An older lady comes into the room and tries to tend to her facial wounds, stating that she is making her 'nice for the client'. She attempts to escape by leaning forward and biting off the nose of the woman, then taking her keys. However, since Paxton's escape, the security at the factory has increased significantly. Beth is taken to a mansion, where she finds a room filled with heads, with Paxton's head at the center of the room. She is then taken to a room in the factory and is strapped to a chair. Stuart enters and explains about Elite Hunting. He unties her from the chair and almost decides to escape with her but then knocks her out. Whitney is taken to Todd's cell and strapped to a chair, where he gleefully terrorizes her with a circular saw but loses his nerve after accidentally cutting through part of her skull. Horrified by what he has done, Todd tries to leave without finishing off Whitney but one of the guards reminds him that he is contractually obligated to kill her and cannot leave until he does so. Todd angrily refuses, prompting the other guards to turn some savage dogs loose and maul him to death. The Elite Hunting representatives try to find someone to finish with Whitney, inquiring whether an Italian cannibal  who is eating Miroslav alive and a man who has his victim chained to an electrified metal bed are interested. Stuart, now torturing Beth and blaming her for Todd's death, takes the offer on Whitney and decapitates her with a machete . As he returns to finish off Beth, she seduces him into releasing her from the chair, then fights him off and chains Stuart to the chair, driving a needle into his ear canal and screaming for the gun-drawing guards to \\\"get Sasha!\\\". Beth makes the Elite Hunting boss an offer: she will pay the full fee to become a customer. When she is told that she must kill somebody to leave, Beth suddenly turns into a stone cold killer. She cuts off Stuart's genitals throwing them to the guard dogs, leaving him to bleed to death, as he screams in pain. Per the standard contract, Beth is given an Elite Hunting tattoo. In the closing sequence, Axelle is lured from the village festival into the woods by the street children, where Beth surprises and beheads her, allowing the gang to play soccer with her head.\",\n          \" 14-year-old Max Goof is the son of Goofy Goof. The two have a tense relationship. On the last day of school before the summer break, Max and his best friends P.J. and Robert \\\"Bobby\\\" Zimmeruski hijack the auditorium stage in the middle of Principal Mazur's speech, creating a small concert where Max performs while costumed as the pop singer Powerline. The performance succeeds in making Max a school celebrity and impressing his love interest Roxanne; but He, P.J. and Bobby are sent to Mazur's office. Roxanne speaks with Max and agrees to go with him to a party where Powerline's concert will be aired live, but Mazur forewarns Goofy that Max's actions may result in facing capital punishment. Goofy desperately decides to take Max on a fishing trip to Lake Destiny, Idaho, following a map route he and his father took years ago, and shoves Max into his AMC Pacer station wagon. However, he is oblivious to what Max is planning to do with Roxanne. Max stops by Roxanne's house to call off their date, but when Roxanne says she will just have to go with someone else, Max instead fabricates a story about his father knowing Powerline. He tells her that he will be on stage at the concert with Powerline. Goofy plans his own trip against Max's wishes. Max hurts Goofy's feelings after his father humiliates him at an opossum-based theme park. While camping, Pete and P.J. join them. Following Pete's advice to keep Max under control, Goofy takes his son fishing and performs the Perfect Cast fishing technique, luring Bigfoot to their camp. Pete and P.J. flee, leaving Goofy and Max to spend the night with Bigfoot. At night, while Goofy is still sleeping, Max alters the map route to Los Angeles, where the concert is to take place. The next morning, Goofy decides to make Max the navigator of the trip. The two go to several locations that satisfy both of them. They stop by a motel where they meet Pete and P.J. again. When Pete overhears a conversation between Max and P.J., he tells Goofy that Max has duped him in traveling to Los Angeles. The next day, Goofy and Max come to a junction: One leading to Idaho, the other to California. Max chooses the route to California, making Goofy stop the car and storm off in anger. The car drives off on its own; Goofy and Max chase after it and end up at a river. Goofy reveals that no matter how old Max gets, he will always be his son and the two reconcile with each other. Realizing that Max had promised to Roxanne to go to the Powerline concert, Goofy decides to take him to Los Angeles. But the two nearly plummet down a waterfall, before Max saves Goofy, using the Perfect Cast technique. Goofy and Max get to Los Angeles and they end up onstage and dance with Powerline, watched by Pete, P.J. and Roxanne on separate televisions. Goofy and Max return to Roxanne's house in their damaged car. Max tells the truth to Roxanne, but she accepts it and admits she always had feelings for him ever since he first said, \\\"Ahyuck!\\\" Goofy's car explodes, but he safely falls through the porch roof of Roxanne's house, and he's introduced to her by Max.\",\n          \"As a cub, Alex the Lion was called Alakay and was the son of Zuba , the alpha lion. Though Zuba tries to teach Alakay to be a hunter, the cub is more interested in dancing, and is captured by poachers when Makunga , Zuba's rival, challenges Zuba to a fight for the position of alpha lion. Alakay is forced into a crate, and taken away despite Zuba's attempts to rescue him. The crate falls into the ocean where it drifts to New York. There, Alakay is renamed Alex and sent to the Central Park Zoo where he grew up, meeting Marty the Zebra, Melman the Giraffe, and Gloria the Hippopotamus. The events of the first film are then described through a series of news flashes. In the present time, Alex the Lion , Marty the Zebra , Melman the Giraffe , Gloria the Hippopotamus , the Penguins Skipper (voiced by [[Tom McGrath , Kowalski (voiced by [[Chris Miller , Private , and Rico , the Chimpanzees Mason  and Phil, and even the Lemurs King Julien , Maurice , and Mort  board a repaired airplane to fly back to New York. The plane takes off, but crash-lands in continental Africa. In Africa the animals are amazed to find more of their kind. Alex is reunited with Zuba and his mother. Marty fits in with a herd of zebra who all look and sound exactly like him. Hypochondriac Melman becomes a witch doctor. Gloria attracts the attention of a smooth-talking hippo named Moto Moto . Meanwhile, the penguins set about repairing the plane. They carjack several jeeps under \\\"Operation Tourist Trap\\\", leaving the tourists stranded in the jungle. Nana , a tough old woman known for beating up Alex in the first film, takes charge of the group (\\\"We are [[Survivor . Unfortunately, life in Africa is not as wonderful as it first seemed. Makunga, still determined to take the position of alpha lion, reminds Zuba that Alex must complete a traditional coming-of-age challenge that he did not complete. Alex, thinking that the challenge is a dance contest  competes against the strongest lion, Teetsi  who was recommended by Makunga and loses quickly. To avoid banishing his own son for failing, Zuba relinquishes his title as Alpha lion. Makunga immediately takes the position and ousts Alex and his family. Marty, meanwhile, begins to feel upset because there is nothing unique about him. Melman is happy until he learns that he has the same symptoms that apparently caused the previous witch doctor to die. Melman is also forlorn about Gloria dating Moto Moto, as Melman has secretly loved her for a long time. Gloria goes on a date with Moto Moto and quickly realizes that he only loves her for her large body. The next day, the animals panic when the watering hole dries up. Determined to make up for his earlier failure, Alex and Marty leave the reserve to investigate. They discover that the stranded New Yorkers, under the instruction of Nana, have dammed up the river and built a primitive civilization. Alex is captured by a trap, forcing Marty to abandon him to seek help. Meanwhile, Zuba hears from Makunga what Alex did and goes to assist him. Back on the reserve, King Julien suggests that the animals offer a sacrifice in the volcano, Mount Kilimanjaro, to appease the water gods. Believing that he will die soon, Melman volunteers to be sacrificed. Gloria stops him just in time and Marty arrives to tell them about Alex. The trio, the penguins, and several chimpanzees use the newly-fixed plane to execute a rescue. However, Alex has already managed to rescue both himself and his father by dancing for the New Yorkers, who fondly remember him from the zoo. The other animals arrive to pick them up with the plane , and together they all destroy the dam, freeing the water. Meanwhile, back at the volcano, Mort turns up after being chased through the jungle by a shark. The shark falls into the volcano, completing the sacrifice  and causing King Julien to think that he brought back the water. As the watering hole fills, Makunga angrily makes a stand for control. However, Alex manages to remove Makunga from power by tricking Nana into attacking him. Zuba gives the alpha position to Alex, but Alex refuses, resulting in both father and son becoming co-leaders. The movie ends as Skipper marries a bobble-head hula doll from the plane and leaves on a honeymoon in Monte Carlo with the chimpanzees, and a huge tub of diamonds and gold, leaving Alex, Marty, Melman, Gloria and The Lemurs to happily remain in Africa with Alex's parents.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\":
